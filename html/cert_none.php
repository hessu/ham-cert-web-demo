To obtain access to exclusive Amateur Radio services at web sites
and systems supporting <b>Amateur Radio Certificate Authentication</b> you'll need to
obtain an <b>Amateur Radio Certificate</b> from one of the trusted <b>Certificate Authorities</b>
and then install it in your web browser or application.

<p>Currently, the following <b>Certificate Authorities</b> are trusted by this testing service:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ARRL Logbook of the World (LoTW)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Additional Certificate Authorities will be added to the list as they
become available. The authority will be required to properly validate
the license status of the users, on a level comparable to the LoTW
checks. They also have to provide a properly maintained Certificate
Revocation List for the purpose of revoking
certificates which have accidentally been issued to non-amateur
users, or when the private key has been leaked or lost by the user, or
when the license of the amateur radio operator expires.
